class TruncatingPipeline(Pipeline):

    The Pipeline class is the class from which all pipelines inherit. Refer to this class for methods shared across
    different pipelines.

    Base class implementing pipelined operations. Pipeline workflow is defined as a sequence of the following
    operations:

        Input -> Tokenization -> Model Inference -> Post-Processing (task dependent) -> Output

    Pipeline supports running on CPU or GPU through the device argument (see below).

    Some pipeline, like for instance :class:`~transformers.FeatureExtractionPipeline` (:obj:`'feature-extraction'` )
    output large tensor object as nested-lists. In order to avoid dumping such large structure as textual data we
    provide the :obj:`binary_output` constructor argument. If set to :obj:`True`, the output will be stored in the
    pickle format.

    This class extends the Pipeline by adding arguments for truncation, padding, and maximum length to the tokenization.

class TruncatingTextClassificationPipeline(TruncatingPipeline):
    """
    Text classification pipeline using any :obj:`ModelForSequenceClassification`. See the `sequence classification
    examples <../task_summary.html#sequence-classification>`__ for more information.

    This text classification pipeline can currently be loaded from :func:`~transformers.pipeline` using the following
    task identifier: :obj:`"sentiment-analysis"` (for classifying sequences according to positive or negative
    sentiments).

    If multiple classification labels are available (:obj:`model.config.num_labels >= 2`), the pipeline will run a
    softmax over the results. If there is a single label, the pipeline will run a sigmoid over the result.

    The models that this pipeline can use are models that have been fine-tuned on a sequence classification task. See
    the up-to-date list of available models on `huggingface.co/models
    <https://huggingface.co/models?filter=text-classification>`__.
